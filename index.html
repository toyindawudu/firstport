      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <h5>These sections are a little bit difficult for a number of reasons. Firstly you want to do a good job without coming across like a narcissist but most importantly <span>you want to impress prospective visitors</span>. But here goes, just a little bit of information on me. </h5>

        <div class="about-content">
          <p> Hello, I'm <span class="name">Toyin Dawudu</span>, making the transition into the Technology space as a Developer based in London, United Kingdom.<br><br> By the way, I am a self-taught <span class="job-title">Front-end Developer</span> and have a passion for learning and creating things with my hands, whether it's a podcast or building a website using PSD designs or other means.<br><br> Previously I used to work in Advertising, Research and insight to be specific. All my years in advertising can be summarised in understanding audiences and providing actionable information for why brands should advertise with business X (wherever I was at the time).<br><br> Looking forward to learning as much as I can on this journey. I am interested in working on as many side-projects as possible to improve my skills, so let me know if you have anything at all.
